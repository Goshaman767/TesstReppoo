                In the HTML DOM club we will be going over a couple coding launguages, some of these launguages would
                contain "HTML, CSS, JS, ViewJS". Most of these are contained in HTML DOM which are "HTML, CSS, and JS" the last one
                "viewJS" is a JS tool that makes makes your website interactive in an easy way.  
                Some tools that we are going to use would be Canvas, GitHub, and maybe Bootstrap. Canvas is quite simple to explain since
                all it does is draw pixels on the whitespace(blank areas between elements) using JS. Then we have GitHub which 
                we are going to use for sharing our sites via a repository. And finnaly we have Bootstrap which greatly simplifies 
                the use of HTML by automaticly creating the css document.
