                Web Dev club
            </h1>
            <p>
                Hello, this is the Web Dev club. We made this club so that kids like you had a chance at not using 
                limited programs such as google sites, Weebly, Wix, Wordpress etc. We want everyone to be able to
                code and create websites as originally should, using "HTML, CSS, ViewJS, Bootstrap, Canvas, and JS".
            </p>
            <p>
                Why should you learn this? well because as previusly stated sites such as google sites, are insanely
                limited. For example, this site was completly created by me using only HTML, JS, and CSS. So we want everyone
                to be able to do what we can do, thats why we started this club.
            </p>
